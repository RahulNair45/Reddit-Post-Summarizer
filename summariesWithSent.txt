Discussion: It's been 11 Years today since release
======================================
- On Xbox 360 no less.
- GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas, and 4 all came out within the span of 8 years I remember the early days of online, like the few months after release.
- We would probably be getting GTA 7 on the way by now, and already had another spin off like Vice City was at the time.
- Remember when we got 3 amazing GTA's on the same console Oh damn, one of the best video game characters I ever played!
- Itâ€™s also been 11 years since Steven Ogg was happy to be trevor.

Discussion: 5 years after the original post, showing my Grandma playing Wii Fit every morning for 10 years, Im excited to update you that she is still going!! She wakes up every morning and does exercises to stay fit!! Almost at 16 years!!
===================================================================================================================================================================================================================================
- I just felt 10 times fatter because of this post for not doing anything.
- Because all I can do is give her an e-hug.
- The craziest thing is that that Wii is so tough it is still holding up after 16 years of daily usage.
- Wow, kudos to your fit grandma, it's so nice and inspiring seeing this.
- Making the assumption she has traveled in the last 15 years.
