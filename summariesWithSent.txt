======================================
- On Xbox 360 no less.
- GTA 3, Vice City, San Andreas, and 4 all came out within the span of 8 years I remember the early days of online, like the few months after release.
- We would probably be getting GTA 7 on the way by now, and already had another spin off like Vice City was at the time.
- Remember when we got 3 amazing GTA's on the same console Oh damn, one of the best video game characters I ever played!
- It’s also been 11 years since Steven Ogg was happy to be trevor.

Discussion: GTA 6 TRAILER DROPPED NOW
=========================
- It actually has an artstyle and isn't just trying to look as real as possible.
- Anyways, I noticed that it sometimes looks photorealistic, especially the parts that are phone videos with a pretty convincing "low quality" feel, but you can still tell it's a game, it's a GTA, and I really like that.
- so much thickness in the trailer Ngl the alligator going inside the store was funny as shit yeah that looks like gta6 to me This will probably be the last GTA in most middle aged people's lifetime!
- as a South Floridian born and raised, gonna be pretty surreal lmao I still have 2 years to a) buy a decent console or b) build a gaming pc It feels crazy watching a real trailer for GTA VI.
- Please everyone take care of your health we need to be there in '25.

Discussion: Thanks to r/gaming, after 4 years of work, I finally found a publisher for my nostalgic helicopter game! (Cleared Hot)
======================================================================================================================
- This is so crazy to me because I played Microprose games growing up.
- Holy fuck this game from my childhood I can tell you must have been a fan of the Stike series (Desert strike and such).
- I posted here with a prototype 3 years ago, and that got the attention of the Microprose CEO, who reached out to me on twitter/X.
- My mom bought me Falcon 4.0 when I was 11 or 12 and I read that if you learned the game you could fly a real F-16.
- We stayed in touch and then [you guys blew up our new trailer](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1dabzqo/i_got_tired_of_waiting_for_a_desert_strike_remake/) and that got it moving forward.

Discussion: How to start world war 3
========================
- Team Fortress 3.
- Half Life Alyx 2

Valve counting to 3 at this point might actually be a more celebrated event than HL3.
- II, which costs $70 in total.
- Half Life 3


The Half Life trading card game “YES, I finally got the 5 star ‘Beach Party Alyx’ hero!” “Do you guys not have phones?” Half life 3 MOBILE  
That would radicalize me xD The weapons sold as gatcha

at least 100x pull for Crossbow MK.

Discussion: Silent Hill 2 on PS2 (emulated at 8K) vs the remake
===================================================
- How well they did with the graphics of the remake.
- Don't forget that on original PS2 the game was played in 640x480.
- Unsettling.
- The original definitely had a look.
- By cleaning up the graphics, it loses a tiny bit of creepiness  I’ve been enjoying playing the remake with the 90s graphics filter enabled, it really helps it feel closer to the original.

Discussion: Nintendo: stop copying us!
==========================
- It's a patent lawsuit.
- They sued for patent not for copyright

Edit: Guys...
- But it's not about copying monsters.
- It's like telling writers to not be influenced by Shakespeare.
- But it added that it was "unaware" of the specific patents that it had been accused of infringing.

Discussion: Helldivers 2 Has Been Delisted From Over 100 Countries on Steam
===============================================================
- One of Sony's slogans is "Play Has No Limits", you know, unless you live one of those 100s of countries.
- was it all a dream?
- It's so dumb, it's impressive This whole helldivers controversy has been crazy.
- I thought Sony was smart(or at least pretending to be smart) when they announced more games coming out to PC day one.
- Ahh Sony, snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.

Discussion: Starfield has lost 97% of its Steam players in less than six months
===================================================================
- They spent 7 years making the game.
- Which game has more players now, Starfield or Skyrim?
- Makes me worried for Elder Scrolls 6 if this was their “passion project” They overcharged for an extremely underwhelming game.
- More like a meh.
- Pointless spaceships where u can just fast travel everywhere, which made getting in your ship even more pointless, ridiculous amount of loading screens even when played on a SSD.
